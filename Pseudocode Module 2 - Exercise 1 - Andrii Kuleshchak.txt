// A pseudocode program that prompts the user for a refrigerator model name and the interior height, width, and depth in inches
// And prints the fridge name and its capacity

// Plan: 1. Declare all the variables
// Plan: 2. Input: we're going to get a refrigerator model name and the interior height, width, and depth in inches. A user will input them.
// Plan: 3. Process: Calculate the refrigerator capacity in cubic feet by multiplying the height, width, and depth to get cubic inches and dividing by 1728 (the number of cubic inches in a cubic foot). Use named constants where appropriate for your calculation.
// Plan: 4. Output: Finally, we will print the refrigerator module name and capacity in cubic feet.


START

// Declaring all the variables
DECLARE fridgeName, height, width, depth, capacity
DECLARE CONSTANT cubicInchesPerCubicFoot = 1728


// Input: Collect fridge info
PRINT "Please enter the fridge model name: "
INPUT fridgeName

PRINT "Please enter the interior height in inches:"
INPUT height

PRINT "Please enter the interior width in inches:"
INPUT width

PRINT "Please enter the interior depth in inches:"
INPUT depth


// Process: calculating the fridge capacity
capacity = height * width * depth / cubicInchesPerCubicFoot


// Output: printing the fridge name and the capacity in cubic feet
PRINT "The fridge model name is " + fridgeName + ", and the capacity in cubic feet is: " + capacity
