// A Pseudocode program to calculate and print the overdrawn fee and the new balance

// Plan: 1. Declare all the variables
// Plan: 2. Input: we're going to get the account balance and number of times the account was overdrawn. A user will input them.
// Plan: 3. Process: calculate the fee and the new balance
// Plan: 4. Output: printing the fee and the new account balance
